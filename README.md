A demo website for a fake company.  .NET Core, Angular, Web API, C#, etc.

This site is mostly functional, but hardly beautiful.  But it does demonstrate some core development compentencies, working with Angular, MVC, CodeFirst database design, dependency injection and a basic unit testing strategy.

There are a few things that "should" be patched up still.  Putting this together took me a couple of hours, I'll try to touch it up more in the future.
